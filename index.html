            <p>The corrosive effect of rust is the age-old nemesis of metals, but it can be prevented. Zinc electroplating is a method of metal 
              plating that stops rust and corrosion in its tracks.The way zinc plating is done is by electronically depositing a layer of zinc 
              on the surface of another metal which is prone to rust, where it serves as a barrier due to its ability to resist corrosion. It is 
              most commonly applied to iron and steel, metals which are popular due to their strength but are susceptible to rusting.Zinc 
              electroplating is a popular method used across automobile and construction industries, and nearly a half of zinc produced globally 
              is used for galvanization processes. Therefore it would not surprise you that there are multiple types of zinc plating used for varying 
              degrees of zinc coating. What follows describes each of them and their uses.</p>

            <h4 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Black Zinc Plating</h4>
            <p>Black Zinc Plating refers to the color of the chromate that is applied during the post plating process. It includes a layer of zinc 
              applied to a parts surface followed by black chromate applied over the zinc. Black Zinc is commonly specified for its dark appearance 
              and protective properties. Black chromate offers additional corrosion protection by protecting the zinc plating and also provides a dark 
              to deep black appearance depending on the surface condition of the part. Black Zinc is an effective finish that provides excellent cosmetic 
              benefits to most parts however it is not suitable for every application. It is common to notice the color change from deep black to 
              greenish-brown as the finish breaks down over time. Because of this color change, Black Zinc may not be the right finish for highly 
              visible components with strict cosmetic requirements. The appearance can also become compromised on parts requiring a sealer often 
              producing streaks or a dull gray appearance, most noticeable on large flat components.</p>

            <h4 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Copper Plating</h4>
            <p>Copper electroplating is the process of electroplating a layer of copper onto the surface of a metal object. Copper is used both as a 
              standalone coating and as an undercoat onto which other metals are subsequently plated. The copper layer can be decorative, provide 
              corrosion resistance, increase electrical and thermal conductivity, or improve the adhesion of additional deposits to the substrate.
              Copper electroplating takes place in an electrolytic cell using electrolysis. As with all plating processes, the part to be plated must 
              be cleaned before depositing metal to remove soils, grease, oxides, and defects.[4][5] After precleaning, the part is immersed in the 
              cell's aqueous electrolyte solution and functions as the cathode. A copper anode is also immersed in the solution. During plating, a 
              direct electric current is applied to the cell which causes the copper in the anode to dissolve into the electrolyte through oxidation, 
              losing electrons and ionizing into copper cations. </p>

            <h4 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Chrome Plating</h4>
            <p>Chrome plating (less commonly chromium plating) is a technique of electroplating a thin layer of chromium onto a metal object. A chrome 
              plated part is called chrome, or is said to have been chromed. The chromium layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, 
              facilitate cleaning, or increase surface hardness. Sometimes, a less expensive substitute for chrome such as nickel may be used for 
              aesthetic purposes. Chromium compounds used in electroplating are toxic. In most countries, their disposal is tightly regulated. Some fume 
              suppressants used to control the emission of airborne chromium from plating baths are also toxic, making disposal even more difficult.</p>

            <h4 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Nickel Plating</h4>
            <p>The technology of nickel electroplating has been extensively developed, particularly during the last 50 years making it possible to 
              efficiently produce a broad range of industrial coatings for both decorative and functional applications. Electroplated nickel is 
              commercially important, with upwards of 150,000 tonnes being deposited worldwide each year. This widespread use reflects nickelâ€™s 
              beneficial properties and versatility as a coating material. A particular feature of electroplating is that, by modifying the composition 
              of the electrolyte and the operating conditions, the properties and appearance of the nickel can be customised to specific needs. 
              Electroplated nickel is used extensively to enhance the utility, value and appeal of manufactured products such as consumer goods. Other 
              nickel coatings are used to improve the physical properties such as resistance to wear, heat or corrosion. In many important applications, 
              the nickel coating serves the dual purpose of providing a bright, attractive finish as well as imparting improved corrosion resistance or 
              other functional properties.</p>

            <h4 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Black Oxide</h4>
            <p>Black oxide or blackening is a conversion coating for ferrous materials, stainless steel, copper and copper based alloys, zinc, powdered 
              metals, and silver solder. It is used to add mild corrosion resistance, for appearance, and to minimize light reflection. To achieve 
              maximal corrosion resistance the black oxide must be impregnated with oil or wax. One of its advantages over other coatings is its 
              minimal buildup.Hot baths of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), nitrates such as sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and/or nitrites such as sodium nitrite 
              (NaNO2) at 141 Â°C (286 Â°F) are used to convert the surface of the material into magnetite (Fe3O4). Water must be periodically added to 
              the bath, with proper controls to prevent a steam explosion. Hot blackening involves dipping the part into various tanks. The workpiece 
              is usually dipped by automated part carriers for transportation between tanks. These tanks contain, in order, alkaline detergent, water, 
              sodium hydroxide at 140.5 Â°C (284.9 Â°F) (the blackening compound), and finally the sealant, which is usually oil.</p>

            <p>Gold plating is a method of depositing a thin layer of gold onto the surface of another metal, most often copper or silver (to make 
              silver-gilt), by chemical or electrochemical plating. Plating refers to modern coating methods, such as the ones used in the electronics 
              industry, whereas gilding is the decorative covering of an object with gold, which typically involve more traditional methods and much 
              larger objects.Gold plating is often used in electronics, to provide a corrosion-resistant electrically conductive layer on copper, 
              typically in electrical connectors and printed circuit boards. With direct gold-on-copper plating, the copper atoms tend to diffuse 
              through the gold layer, causing tarnishing of its surface and formation of an oxide and/or sulphide layer.</p>
